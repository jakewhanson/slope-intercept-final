
Thanks Jake, and I'm glad you enjoyed the class, and the Breakout labs.  I will be updating the videos and adding more over the summer.

Excellent job on this program!!!

Only comment is on the Line property constructor, you would want to break that into 2 constructors, one that takes 2 Point class parameters, and one that takes 2 Point class and 1 float for slope.  Reason being that we would most likely only know 2 points or 1 point and a slope at line initialization time, so we'd want different constructors for those two events.

Have a great summer, hope to see you in other classes down the road.
