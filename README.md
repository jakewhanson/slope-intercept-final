# slope-intercept-final
Final Project for COP 2001 - Slope Intercept in C++ using OpenGL.

This program is a visual slope-intercept calculation program. Using the command prompt, the user is asked to select what type of slope calculation they would like to do. After that, the user is prompted to enter their coordinates, and from there, the program calculates the necessary values and shows them to the user, as well as opens another window and uses OpenGL to produce a visual representation of the slope-intercept line, represented by a dark blue line on a grid. The program loops until the users exits the program.

This final project made me realize the whole point of the course, object-oriented programming. This program really showed me how versatile and even how necessary using object-oriented programming regularly can be; I found this program to be a little challenging at first, but I was super happy with the final product.

This project was started and completed in April 2021.

The "fgcugl" folder and subsequent files were provided by Professor Paul Allen at Florida Gulf Coast University.
