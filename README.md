# slope-intercept-final
Final Project for COP 2001 - Slope Intercept in C++ using OpenGL.

This program is a visual slope-intercept calculation program. Using the command prompt, the user is asked to select what type of slope calculation they would like to do. After that, the user is prompted to enter their coordinates, and from there, the program calculates the necessary values and shows them to the user. The program loops until the users exits the program.
